      <description>I have been using macOS on the laptop for a few years, but recently I switched back to Ubuntu. It has several advantages for my usage pattern: the environment which my programs use in production, Docker with fast FS and without imposed updates, and a lot more control over the system.
One thing that I miss is Time Machine. Having up-to-date backups is extremely important. It helps when your computer stops working normally, or it has been stolen, or you just want to move from one laptop to another.</description>

      <description>Sometimes I find interesting links or have some thoughts about software engineering problems that I want to save and share. It&amp;rsquo;s not enough for an article in the blog, so I don&amp;rsquo;t publish it there. That is why I&amp;rsquo;d created this page, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to post some short messages here.</description>
