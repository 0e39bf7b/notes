      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d used CentOS as a production environment for working projects. Some time ago Red Hat announced its plans to replace stable CentOS 8 with rolling release CentOS Stream. So, CentOS had been replaced with Oracle Linux. Today I&amp;rsquo;ve found that Oracle has its own Linux kernel build that is called Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel. They add some features like Ksplice that look interesting for high-load enterprise platforms.</description>

      <description>Do you feel like you getting old and new technologies do not excite you anymore? Do you think that you have seen most things before? I&amp;rsquo;ve found an interesting discussion on Hacker News about this topic. Different people share their feelings and ways of getting through this period of life.</description>

      <description>Falling down the rabbit hole of HiDPI screens and fractional scaling on Linux desktops I came across an interesting discussion on Reddit. It contains a lot of useful links that help to form an opinion on the subject.
I found that in the KDE X11 session fractional scaling is implemented on Qt Framework level, so each app scales its output itself. Gnome uses a different technique. It implies rendering everything at an integer factor and then downscaling using a raster operation.</description>

      <description>The majority of GUI apps on Linux are written using some toolkit like GTK or Qt. Such libs provide high-level abstractions like buttons or labels but the real rendering is executed on the backend like X11 or Wayland. I&amp;rsquo;d never thought about it. Today I&amp;rsquo;ve found that the X11 backend uses Xlib. To understand what level of abstraction GUI libraries provide, you can take a look at this small tutorial. After writing a Hello World with Xlib it becomes clear for me why developers introduce more abstraction layers.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m learning the STM32 platform. The code generation in STM32CubeIDE makes it easier to configure different MCU subsystems and start writing &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; apps. However, it can be difficult to understand how all this magic works. Fortunately, there is a comprehensive explanation in the STM32CubeMX for STM32 configuration and initialization C code generation user manual in section 6.1.</description>

      <description>Some time ago I&amp;rsquo;d bought Focusrite Scarlett gen3 audio interface because it&amp;rsquo;s one of the devices that work on Linux out of the box. Unfortunately, some features of the device can be accessed only through Focusrite Control that is not available on Linux. Recently I&amp;rsquo;d found an interesting stream about improving Focusrite Scarlett Driver that shows how to access additional features of the device on the Linux platform. It is worth watching if you are interested in reverse engineering and Linux drivers.</description>

      <description>I have a network smb share with different videos that I want to watch over network on my devices. Today I&amp;rsquo;d tried to watch a video on my Kubuntu laptop with VLC. It prints errors like:
Your input can&#39;t be opened: VLC is unable to open the MRL &#39;smb://10.0.0.1/Share/video.mkv&#39;. Check the log for details. I&amp;rsquo;d checked logs and found nothing. I&amp;rsquo;d tried to set username and password in the settings as suggested on the Internet with no results.</description>

      <description>Zoom has become the de facto standard for online communications for me. On Linux Zoom depends on ibus. It looks a bit strange because Zoom works fine without this dependency and in some cases, ibus can make problems. There is a nice article about how to repack Zoom to work without ibus.</description>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve found a page, explaining the types of packages in Ubuntu. It gives the information about strengths and weaknesses of each packaging system and discusses what is the best choice for different usage scenarios. The article gives me a lot to think about. Although certain solutions seem controversial to me, the article clarifies the vision of Canonical for package systems.</description>

      <description>I have a dual boot setup on my PC: Ubuntu and Windows 10. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s required to reload Windows for processing system updates. By default, Grub loads the first system from the list, which is Ubuntu. It&amp;rsquo;s inconvenient. I think it&amp;rsquo;s better to make Grub remember the last loaded OS and start it after reboot.
To achieve this behaviour you need to perform such steps:
  Add to /etc/default/grub following strings:</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;d found that ping utility on Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 21.04 works without root permissions, suid flag, or CAP_NET_RAW capability. In the Kernel documentation it is said that ping uses ICMP_PROTO datagram sockets and it&amp;rsquo;s possible to allow users without root permissions to create such sockets:
 ping_group_range - 2 INTEGERS
  Restrict ICMP_PROTO datagram sockets to users in the group range. The default is &amp;ldquo;1 0&amp;rdquo;, meaning, that nobody (not even root) may create ping sockets.</description>

      <description>I use Thunderbird as an e-mail client. I&amp;rsquo;d configured several rules on the server side for splitting messages from INBOX into several folders (Jira, GitLab, etc.). It&amp;rsquo;s important to execute these rules on the server side because I have several clients and, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to make the same rules for each client. By default, Thunderbird checks only the INBOX folder of the IMAP account, so I had no notifications about new mail in the other folders.</description>

      <description>There is a Full HD screen on my 14&amp;quot; laptop. It looks like some sort of HiDPI for me, and that is why controls of an interface on native resolution are too small, so it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to use. On Windows, an interface was scaled for 125% and looks a lot better.
I tried to make the same settings on Ubuntu 21.04, and there were some issues. There are two options: a new Wayland session and a more traditional Xorg session.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve used to ask questions about different open source projects on Freenode IRC several years ago. Today I&amp;rsquo;ve found that Freenode staff members had left the company and started Libera.Chat. You can find the roots of this decision on Wiki page.</description>

      <description>Recently Docker has updated subscriptions, and now Docker Desktop remains free only for individuals or small businesses. I think it&amp;rsquo;s OK that Docker as a company wants to get money from their products. At the same time, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit strange to change the rules of the game for existing products. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how the community reacts to this announcement.</description>

      <description>One of the most important parts of laptop security is disk encryption. It can help to save your personal data if you lost your computer or it was stolen. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to encrypt everything. You need some code to ask for the password from the user and decrypt the system.
There are several options when you work with Ubuntu:
 encrypt only home directory; encrypt the operating system partition during the installation process and rely on UEFI Secure Boot for Linux kernel verification; encrypt not only the operating system partition, but also the boot partition; look at Full Disk Encryption Howto for more details.</description>

      <description>I have been using macOS on the laptop for a few years, but recently I switched back to Ubuntu. It has several advantages for my usage pattern: the environment which my programs use in production, Docker with fast FS and without imposed updates, and a lot more control over the system.
One thing that I miss is Time Machine. Having up-to-date backups is extremely important. It helps when your computer stops working normally, or it has been stolen, or you just want to move from one laptop to another.</description>
