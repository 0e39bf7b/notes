  <p>Some time ago I&rsquo;d bought Focusrite Scarlett gen3 audio interface because it&rsquo;s one of the devices
that work on Linux out of the box. Unfortunately, some features of the device can be accessed only
through <a href="https://focusrite.com/ru/node/63">Focusrite Control</a> that is not available on Linux.
Recently I&rsquo;d found
<a href="https://youtu.be/1JCgQrukVBs">an interesting stream about improving Focusrite Scarlett Driver</a> that
shows how to access additional features of the device on the Linux platform. It is worth watching if
you are interested in reverse engineering and Linux drivers.</p>

  <p>I have a network smb share with different videos that I want to watch over network on my devices.
Today I&rsquo;d tried to watch a video on my Kubuntu laptop with VLC. It prints errors like:</p>
<pre><code>Your input can't be opened:
VLC is unable to open the MRL 'smb://10.0.0.1/Share/video.mkv'. Check the log for details.
</code></pre><p>I&rsquo;d checked logs and found nothing. I&rsquo;d tried to set username and password in the settings as
<a href="https://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/vlc-remote-files.html">suggested on the Internet</a> with no
results. I&rsquo;d also tried to install <code>kio-fuse</code> as
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/er2udt/opening_video_files_from_dolphin_with_vlc_in/">described on Reddit</a>
— nothing changed. So I think, there is some bug in the VLC, that is why I used a different
solution:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <code>/usr/share/applications/vlc.desktop</code>.</li>
<li>Remove line <code>X-KDE-Protocols=ftp,http,https,mms,rtmp,rtsp,sftp,smb</code>.</li>
<li>Make sure that <code>kio-fuse</code> installed.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>X-KDE-Protocols</code> instructs Dolphin to pass smb URLs directly to VLC. Without this line, <code>kio</code> mounts
smb share and allows VLC to work with a local file.</p>

Zoom depends on ibus. It looks a bit strange because Zoom works fine without this dependency and in
some cases, ibus can make problems. There is a <a href="https://hashman.ca/zoom/">nice article</a> about how to

  <p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve found <a href="https://ubuntu.com/about/packages">a page</a>, explaining the types of packages
in Ubuntu. It gives the information about strengths and weaknesses of each packaging system and
discusses what is the best choice for different usage scenarios. The article gives me a lot to think
about. Although certain solutions seem controversial to me, the article clarifies the vision of
Canonical for package systems.</p>

  <p>I have a dual boot setup on my PC: Ubuntu and Windows 10. Sometimes it&rsquo;s required to reload Windows
for processing system updates. By default, Grub loads the first system from the list, which is
Ubuntu. It&rsquo;s inconvenient. I think it&rsquo;s better to make Grub remember the last loaded OS and start it
after reboot.</p>
<p>To achieve this behaviour you need to perform such steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add to <code>/etc/default/grub</code> following strings:</p>
<pre><code> GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
 GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true
</code></pre>

<p>Execute <code>sudo update-grub</code>.</p>

  <p>Recently I&rsquo;d found that <code>ping</code> utility on Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 21.04 works without root
permissions, suid flag, or <code>CAP_NET_RAW</code> capability. In the
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt">Kernel documentation</a> it is said
that <code>ping</code> uses <code>ICMP_PROTO</code> datagram sockets and it&rsquo;s possible to allow users without root
permissions to create such sockets:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ping_group_range</strong> - 2 INTEGERS</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Restrict <code>ICMP_PROTO</code> datagram sockets to users in the group range. The default is &ldquo;<code>1 0</code>&rdquo;,
meaning, that nobody (not even root) may create ping sockets. Setting it to &ldquo;<code>100 100</code>&rdquo; would
grant permissions to the single group. &ldquo;<code>0 4294967295</code>&rdquo; would enable it for the world,
&ldquo;<code>100 4294967295</code>&rdquo; would enable it for the users, but not daemons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d checked <code>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ping_group_range</code> and found <code>0 2147483647</code> interval.</p>
<p>Also, there is a
<a href="https://sturmflut.github.io/linux/ubuntu/2015/01/17/unprivileged-icmp-sockets-on-linux/">code example</a>
that demonstrates the use of <code>ICMP_PROTO</code> sockets.</p>

  <p>I use Thunderbird as an e-mail client. I&rsquo;d configured several rules on the server side for splitting
messages from INBOX into several folders (Jira, GitLab, etc.). It&rsquo;s important to execute these rules
on the server side because I have several clients and, I don&rsquo;t want to make the same rules for each
client. By default, Thunderbird checks only the INBOX folder of the IMAP account, so I had no
notifications about new mail in the other folders. Recently I&rsquo;d found that it can be fixed.</p>
<p>To make Thunderbird check for new messages in all folders:</p>
<ul>
<li>open Thunderbird preferences;</li>
<li>open Config Editor;</li>
<li>search for: <code>mail.server.default.check_all_folders_for_new</code>;</li>
<li>change value from <code>False</code> to <code>True</code>.</li>

  <p>There is a Full HD screen on my 14&quot; laptop. It looks like some sort of HiDPI for me, and that is why
controls of an interface on native resolution are too small, so it&rsquo;s difficult to use. On Windows,
an interface was scaled for 125% and looks a lot better.</p>
<p>I tried to make the same settings on Ubuntu 21.04, and there were some issues. There are two
options: a new Wayland session and a more traditional Xorg session.</p>
<p>When I set up a 125% scale for the interface in the Wayland session, it looks great, but some apps
like Google Chrome, VS Code, or Slack look blurry out of the box. For some apps, it&rsquo;s possible to
fix it in some way using experimental features, that can lead to instability and random crashes.
Also, there is
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1718727">an extremely annoying bug in Firefox</a>: some
popups like Multi-Account Containers are cropped and it&rsquo;s impossible to use them. It will be fixed
only in Firefox 93 which will be released in October. There are a lot of small issues on Wayland
like <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/5157">Vim clipboard</a>, that is why I&rsquo;m not sure that Wayland
is ready for desktop now.</p>
<p>When I set up a 125% scale for the interface in the Xorg session all apps work properly, but there
are some artifacts in the interface like black rectangles around windows or black lines in random
places of the screen. It&rsquo;s better than Wayland but still not good enough.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d tried different Linux distributions and different desktop environments to find the best solution
for cases like mine. Xfce and Cinnamon work fine only with x2 and x3 scales. Elementary works with
x2 scale and allows to increase fonts, so texts look fine, but controls are too small. The
co-founder of Elementary
<a href="https://blog.elementary.io/what-is-hidpi/">says it&rsquo;s OK and I just need to buy another laptop</a>.</p>
<p>The solution I found is Kubuntu 21.04 with KDE 5.21.4. It allows setting 125% scale out of the box.
Everything works: Qt apps, GTK apps, Firefox, Google Chrome, and so on. That is why now I&rsquo;m a happy
KDE user.</p>

Docker Desktop remains free only for individuals or small businesses. I think it&rsquo;s OK that Docker as

rules of the game for existing products. We&rsquo;ll see how the community reacts to this announcement.</p>

  <p>One of the most important parts of laptop security is disk encryption. It can help to save your
personal data if you lost your computer or it was stolen. It&rsquo;s impossible to encrypt everything. You
need some code to ask for the password from the user and decrypt the system.</p>
<p>There are several options when you work with Ubuntu:</p>
<ul>
<li>encrypt only home directory;</li>
<li>encrypt the operating system partition during the installation process and rely on UEFI Secure
Boot for Linux kernel verification;</li>
<li>encrypt not only the operating system partition, but also the boot partition; look at
<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Full_Disk_Encryption_Howto_2019">Full Disk Encryption Howto</a>
for more details.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that disk encryption is not free. There is always a performance hit if
you use full disk encryption, but it can be unnoticeable on modern hardware. There are some tests
from Phoronix about disk encryption:</p>

  <p>I have been using macOS on the laptop for a few years, but recently I switched back to Ubuntu. It
has several advantages for my usage pattern: the environment which my programs use in production,
Docker with fast FS and without <a href="https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/183">imposed updates</a>, and
a lot more control over the system.</p>
<p>One thing that I miss is Time Machine. Having up-to-date backups is extremely important. It helps
when your computer stops working normally, or it has been stolen, or you just want to move from one
laptop to another.</p>
<p>Of cause, there are a lot of different backup solutions on Linux. I&rsquo;d found articles like
<a href="https://www.fosslinux.com/44619/best-linux-backup-tools.htm">The 10 Best Linux Backup Tools</a>,
<a href="https://www.ubuntupit.com/best-backup-software-for-linux/">The 15 Best Backup Software For Linux Desktop</a>,
or even
<a href="https://www.tecmint.com/linux-system-backup-tools/">25 Outstanding Backup Utilities for Linux Systems in 2020</a>.
All Linux backup utilities can be divided into two groups.</p>
<p>The utilities from the first group allow you to make incremental backups, data encryption and you
don&rsquo;t have to stop working during the backup creation, but you have to select a directory to backup.
Usually, it&rsquo;s a home directory because there are some pitfalls that stop me from selecting <code>/</code>. That
is why when you need to restore from the backup you have to install fresh Linux distribution
yourself with all your programs and only then restore your data like documents or photos from the
backup.</p>
<p>The second group includes the utilities that make the backup of the entire hard drive and you can
restore the entire system from such a backup. Unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t use the computer during the
backup creation process and I&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s possible to make incremental backups in this
case. When you need to restore from such a backup you can restore only all or nothing. It can be
inconvenient.</p>
<p>I want to find a tool that can backup my data from the home directory but also saves the system
configuration somehow. When I need to restore from the backup the tool should help me to install the
system with all settings and then restore the user data. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve not found such a tool
yet, so I have to use Gnome&rsquo;s default backup solution —
<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/DejaDup">Déjà Dup</a>.</p>
